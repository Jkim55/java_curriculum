# Encapsulation

## Visibility
- PRIVATE: methods/fields marked as private are accessible only within the class.
- PUBLIC: methods/fields marked as public are accessible inside and outside the class definition to access that method / field.
- PROTECTED: methods/fields marked as protected are accessibly to classes that extend / inherit to it.

And any methods/fields that do not have an access modifier, will be defaulted to PRIVATE
